I made this project to improve my javascript logic building skills and i must say i have learnt a lot from this.

Some of the things i learnt are : 
1. After any alert, if i am doing something on the frontend, i should put the alert on a timeout of at least 50ms to allow the DOM to execute the other tasks.
2. I also learnt about how event listeners have to be properly removed otherwise they can stack and cause problems.
3. I also learnt that event listeners use references to the callbacks and therefore we can only remove a listener if it is named.
